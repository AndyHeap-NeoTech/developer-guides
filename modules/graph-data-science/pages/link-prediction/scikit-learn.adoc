:description: This guide explains how to solve a link prediction problem using a scikit-learn binary classifier.

.Goals
[abstract]
In this guide, we will learn how to solve a link prediction problem using a scikit-learn binary classifier and the Graph Data Science Library.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
Please have link:/download[Neo4j^] (version 4.0 or later) and the link:/download-center/#algorithms[Graph Data Science Library^] downloaded and installed.
You will also need to install the Python https://scikit-learn.org/[scikit-learn^] library.

Link Prediction techniques are used to predict future or missing links in graphs.
In this guide we're going to use these techniques predict future co-authorships using scikit-learn and link prediction algorithms from the Graph Data Science Library.

[NOTE]
====
The code examples used in this guide can be found in the https://github.com/neo4j-examples/link-prediction[neo4j-examples/link-prediction^] GitHub repository.
For background reading on link prediction, see the xref:link-prediction/index.adoc[] guide.

[#citation-graph]
== Citation Graph

In this guide, weâ€™re going to use data from the https://aminer.org/citation[DBLP Citation Network^], which includes citation data from various academic sources.
The full dataset is very large, but we're going to use a subset that contains data from a few Software Development Conferences.
