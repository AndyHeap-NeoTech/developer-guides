      <title>Manchester United's Edinson Cavani apologises for 'racist' Instagram post</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/manchester-uniteds-edinson-cavani-apologies-for-racist-instagram-post</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Striker insists he meant no offence and is backed by club&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cavani could still be hit with FA ban despite deleting post&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edinson Cavani has “sincerely apologised” for using the word “&lt;em&gt;negrito&lt;/em&gt;” in a social media post following &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/southampton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Manchester United’s 3-2 win at Southampton on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, stating it was an affectionate greeting to a friend. The club have also moved to support the 33-year-old Uruguayan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavani may face a three-match ban if the Football Association deems the word to be discriminatory or racist, with the governing body scrutinising the incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/manchester-uniteds-edinson-cavani-apologies-for-racist-instagram-post"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lennon the fall guy for Celtic's failure to build on domestic dominance</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/neil-lennon-the-fallguy-celtic-domestic-dominance-scottish-football</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ugly scenes after the League Cup defeat to Ross County reflected a growing sense of frustration among fans &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much for managing Celtic as football’s equivalent to living on Easy Street. Fifteen years ago, Martin O’Neill’s tenure ended with a painful concession of the title on its final day to Rangers. Having stayed a season too long – even by his own admission – Gordon Strachan departed in 2009 with Rangers again the champions; the Celtic support were tired of one-liners and one-dimensional play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Mowbray toiled before being sacked. Having taken charge for the first time, Neil Lennon resigned in 2014 with the staleness of a one-horse race unable to stimulate him any longer. By the time the Ronny Deila project ended, two years later, there was acceptance that this punt was worthy of a smaller club. Celtic raised the bar in hiring Brendan Rodgers but there was only so long the current Leicester City manager would handle being the only fish in a small pond; internal rancour at the onset of season 2018-19 preceded the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/neil-lennon-the-fallguy-celtic-domestic-dominance-scottish-football"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Napoli find truest tribute to Maradona by mirroring his magic against Roma | Nicky Bandini</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/napoli-truest-tribute-maradona-magic-victory-roma-serie-a</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Naples had struggled to find the right way to say farewell to a player who felt like family but the 4-0 win over Roma was fitting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Napoli kicked off against Roma on Sunday night, their captain Lorenzo Insigne went on a lap of the Stadio San Paolo, placing bouquets of flowers beneath the empty stands behind each goal. From the Curva A hung a banner prepared by fans, addressed to Diego Maradona: “Your death comes as a blow to the chest,” it read. “A pain in the heart. Naples swears you eternal love.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/european-roundup-lionel-messi-pays-tribute-to-diego-maradona-in-barca-q"&gt;European roundup: Napoli and Lionel Messi pay tribute to Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/napoli-truest-tribute-maradona-magic-victory-roma-serie-a"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Concussion substitutes trial could begin in Premier League early next year</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/wolves-raul-jimenez-comfortable-surgery-fractured-skull-david-luiz-arsenal</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule change would give teams an extra sub for head injury&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;News follows Raúl Jiménez’s clash of heads with David Luiz &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials of additional permanent substitutes for concussion injuries in the Premier League could begin early in the new year, the Guardian understands. The news comes after Wolves confirmed that their striker Raúl Jiménez had surgery on a fractured skull after a sickening clash of heads &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report"&gt;with Arsenal’s David Luiz&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolves said the Mexico striker was comfortable after the operation. “He has since seen his partner Daniela and is now resting,” the club added in a statement. “He will remain under observation for a few days while he begins his recovery.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/wolves-raul-jimenez-comfortable-surgery-fractured-skull-david-luiz-arsenal"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Köln rejoice in 'miracle of Dortmund' sealed by Haaland's incredible miss | Andy Brassell</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/30/koln-rejoice-miracle-of-dortmund-haaland-miss-bundesliga</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two almost identical goals by Ellyes Skhiri and a last-minute blunder by Haaland ended a 267-day wait for a Bundesliga win&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moments of tension tugged more frequently at Kölsch hearts as the afternoon went on, as the prize got closer and the stakes were raised. Yet Markus Gisdol stood there impassively, as watchful and inscrutable as Professor Yaffle, the woodpecker bookend in Bagpuss. When the final whistle went, the facade melted like an ice sculpture in the Sahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gisdol celebrated wildly, as his players did all over the Westfalen pitch, a mixture of relief and disbelief. The coach grabbed his assistant, Frank Kaspari, for a bear hug, then embraced Kingsley Ehizibue as he made it on to the field, with the defender seeming taken aback by the boss and his sudden eruption of joy. The wait, finally, was over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/30/koln-rejoice-miracle-of-dortmund-haaland-miss-bundesliga"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hatem Ben Arfa rolls back the years for Bordeaux against PSG</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/hatem-ben-arfa-rolls-back-years-bordeaux-psg-ligue-1</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Arfa was brilliant at the weekend, setting up a goal and wreaking havoc against his old club&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_adam_white_?lang=en"&gt;Adam White&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_"&gt;Eric Devin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/"&gt;Get French Football News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatem Ben Arfa has some distance to go before he reaches the proverbial nine lives of a cat, but &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTudxAfayjo&amp;amp;ab_channel=Ligue1UberEats"&gt;Bordeaux’s 2-2 draw with PSG&lt;/a&gt; at the weekend offered evidence that he may be able to write another chapter to his career, even at the age of 33. There were hints that he was clicking into gear against Rennes last weekend, when &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7pKFKiElHYU?t=77"&gt;he scored the winner in a 1-0 victory over his former club&lt;/a&gt;, and he was electric on Saturday in another of his old haunts, setting up a goal and generally wreaking havoc at the Parc des Princes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from an ill-fated sojourn at PSG, Ben Arfa has generally been impressive since his return to France from England five years ago. At Nice he formed a strike partnership with Valère Germain that was as unlikely as it was effective. Nice’s brand of attacking football under Claude Puel was scintillating but it seemed that, given their financial limitations, a realistic tilt at the Champions League places was beyond their means. As a result, Ben Arfa was soon lured to pastures greener, acknowledging as he did so the debt that he owed to the southern club, who had to wait some eight months for him to make his debut following a transfer imbroglio over his aborted spell with Hull City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/hatem-ben-arfa-rolls-back-years-bordeaux-psg-ligue-1"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arsenal defender clashed heads with Raúl Jiménez&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘You may feel ok but after the game you feel the consequences’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson has called for the automatic replacement of players who are involved in a clash of heads after Raúl Jiménez suffered a fractured skull in a collision with David Luiz in Wolves’ &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report"&gt;win at Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Jiménez was taken to hospital where &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/wolves-raul-jimenez-comfortable-surgery-fractured-skull-david-luiz-arsenal"&gt;he had surgery&lt;/a&gt; immediately after the 15th-minute incident, David Luiz played on until halftime before being subsituted.

      <title>Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/30/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mikel Arteta does not seem to have a plan of attack, Everton’s defence must improve and Jürgen Klopp should pick his battles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikel Arteta has been the Arsenal manager for just under a year, and though some things have improved under him – attitude, intensity, FA Cup tally – it’s still not clear what the plan is, especially going forward. And while it is important to emphasise how much Thomas Partey is being missed, the feeling persists that it really doesn’t have to be like this. When Arteta was appointed, he was gifted half a season of minimal expectations, meaning he could experiment in order to find the personnel and formation best able to execute his ideals. But though he did brilliantly to win a trophy, he settled on very little, so his current position is not dissimilar to the one in which he began – except now, he is under pressure. Maybe it is time to give Bukayo Saka, Reiss Nelson and Joe Willock extended runs because really, how much worse – and more tedious – could things get? &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Harris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/30/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>N'Golo Kanté is back where he belongs as Chelsea's Pac-Man in midfield | Jonathan Wilson</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/pac-man-ngolo-kante-is-back-where-he-belongs-in-chelseas-midfield</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gobbling up possession from a holding role is what the Chelsea midfielder does best, as he showed against Tottenham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A run of just two goals conceded in nine games is some riposte to the doubts about Chelsea’s defending. Some doubts remain, but given how exposed Frank Lampard’s side were to the break last season, when they had the worst defensive record of any Chelsea team in 23 years, stifling Tottenham, the kings of the counterattack, is not an achievement to be underplayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/chelsea-tottenham-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Tottenham return to top of table after José Mourinho frustrates Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/pac-man-ngolo-kante-is-back-where-he-belongs-in-chelseas-midfield"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Burdened by genius: Maradona reminds us how peaking young brings its problems | Vic Marks</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/nov/30/maradona-reminds-us-how-peaking-young-brings-its-problems</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a Mexico 86 or Headingley 81 can weigh hard on superstars, which might be why many top coaches come from a lower rung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death of Diego Maradona provided another reminder that life is seldom simple for the sporting superstar. Maradona was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/26/maradona-the-footballer-had-no-flaws-maradona-the-man-was-a-victim" title=""&gt;obviously a footballing genius&lt;/a&gt;, whose later life was, by all accounts, chaotic. In 1986, at the age of 26, the brilliance of his feet, his vision and his deception led to Argentina winning the World Cup. It doesn’t get any better than that. And that surely is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not a common problem since it applies only to geniuses. Where do you go after scaling the highest peaks? This came to mind when I was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/24/ian-botham-covid-19-brexit-headingley-vic-marks" title=""&gt;chatting to Ian Botham&lt;/a&gt; recently. How could he ever hope to surpass what he achieved in the second half of the summer of 1981 at the age of 25? Geoff Hurst was never going to score another hat-trick in a World Cup final after 1966. How can Ben Stokes ever play a better innings than the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/australia-ashes-england-third-test-ben-stokes-sensational" title=""&gt;one at Headingley in 2019&lt;/a&gt;? In the same way, how could Maradona top what he did in Mexico in 1986? I suppose one could also speculate whether Elton John was haunted by the thought that he might never produce a better track than Your Song, which was released in 1970. If so, it did not stop him trying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/nov/30/maradona-reminds-us-how-peaking-young-brings-its-problems"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

One thing I like about all three of them is they are front-footed defenders and they want to put a tackle in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/leah-williamson-leads-way-as-englands-defensive-trio-delight-phil-neville"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>José Mourinho says Tottenham 'just a pony' in title race after draw at Chelsea</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/chelsea-tottenham-premier-league-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;José Mourinho has previous for spoiling 1,000th game celebrations at Stamford Bridge. Remember what happened to Arsène Wenger when he brought up the landmark in charge of Arsenal here? Mourinho’s Chelsea beat them 6-0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the occasion of Roman Abramovich’s 1,000th match as the Chelsea owner and it was a time to reflect on how much he has brought to the club. The Tottenham manager made sure that he could not celebrate with a victory which would have taken Chelsea to the top of the table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/chelsea-tottenham-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>European roundup: Napoli and Lionel Messi pay tribute to Diego Maradona</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/european-roundup-lionel-messi-pays-tribute-to-diego-maradona-in-barca-q</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Napoli wear special kit for 4-0 home win over Roma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Messi pays tribute after scoring in Barcelona win&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Napoli&lt;/strong&gt; honoured the late Diego Maradona with an Argentina-style kit as they overcame &lt;strong&gt;Roma&lt;/strong&gt; 4-0, hours after Lionel Messi paid a personal tribute to his compatriot as Barcelona beat Osasuna by the same scoreline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo Insigne put Napoli ahead with a sublime free kick worthy of Maradona himself in the 30th minute and celebrated by running halfway across the pitch to collect a shirt with the Napoli legend’s name on it. Insigne then set up Fabián Ruiz for the second goal at Stadio San Paulo, which is expected to be renamed in Maradona’s honour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/european-roundup-lionel-messi-pays-tribute-to-diego-maradona-in-barca-q"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Edinson Cavani on target as Manchester United fight back to beat Southampton</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/southampton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The early signs, it has to be said, were not auspicious. As the whistle blew at the start of the second half, Manchester United’s substitute was still at the side of the pitch, fiddling with his bootlaces. On the game went, with Edinson Cavani still on his haunches adjusting his footwear. And with United 2-0 down against a bold and well-organised Southampton side, this little vignette felt like a microcosm of United’s afternoon: a ragged, expensive shambles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/edinson-cavani-fa-investigation-social-media-instagram-post"&gt;Edinson Cavani could face three-game ban as FA investigates social media post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/southampton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Newcastle cancel training with trip to Aston Villa in doubt amid Covid-19 fears</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/newcastle-scrap-training-session-amid-fears-of-coronavirus-outbreak</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Five people among players and staff are now self-isolating &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘It’s been a tough week,’ says manager Steve Bruce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newcastle United were forced to abandon plans to stage a first-team training session on Sunday amid fears they are in the grip of a coronavirus outbreak. Two more players have tested positive over the weekend, meaning five members of the first-team bubble – understood to be four players and one member of staff – are now self-isolating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation has prompted another round of testing, with Steve Bruce waiting anxiously on the results as the club’s training ground is deep-cleaned. Already preparations for Friday night’s trip to Aston Villa have been disrupted and there now has to be some degree of doubt as to whether that Premier League fixture will take place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/newcastle-scrap-training-session-amid-fears-of-coronavirus-outbreak"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Raúl Jiménez head injury overshadows Wolves' impressive win at Arsenal</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most important news to emerge from an unsettling evening was that Raúl Jiménez, who had been carried off on a stretcher with a head injury that left everyone inside the stadium fraught with worry, was conscious and responding to treatment by the time he reached hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody will want to see replays of the collision with David Luiz that held up this game for 10 minutes, and much less will those present want to relive the sound. The shockwave of anxiety that followed was palpable and, while clearer information about Jiménez’s prognosis will emerge in time, the relief when updates about his condition began to circulate was equally pronounced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>In Naples, a city steeped in pagan rites, I saw Maradona cast his spell</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/in-naples-a-city-steeped-in-pagan-rites-i-saw-maradona-cast-his-spell</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A personal memoir of the passionate, intense bond between the Argentinian and his adopted city, which saw his triumphs and his tragic downfall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the evening that Napoli football club won its first ever championship, in May 1987, a graffito was scrawled on the wall of Poggioreale cemetery, on the city’s shoulders as it rises from the gulf of Naples: “&lt;em&gt;Voi non sapete che cosa vi siete persi&lt;/em&gt;” – roughly, you don’t know what you missed. Overnight came the reply: “&lt;em&gt;E chi u l’he detto&lt;/em&gt;?” – who told you we missed it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how Naples thinks, and holds in its heart the mercurial genius largely responsible for winning that scudetto: Diego Maradona. And now that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/26/naples-mourns-death-of-diego-maradona-their-little-rascal" title=""&gt;“Dieguito” himself has passed over to the other side&lt;/a&gt;, the city’s head of cemeteries, Alessio Castiello, and funeral director Gennaro Tammaro, urge the city to commission and erect a statue of, and monument to, Maradona.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/in-naples-a-city-steeped-in-pagan-rites-i-saw-maradona-cast-his-spell"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Echoing stadium may be a wintry void but Arsenal fans cannot wait to return</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/echoing-stadium-may-be-a-wintry-void-but-arsenal-fans-cannot-wait-to-return</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a sense of building excitement as Arsenal prepare to become the first elite club to open their turnstiles since March&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never has a Europa League dead rubber carried this much weight. Arsenal can do more or less as they please when Rapid Vienna visit on Thursday, with qualification from Group B assured and top spot almost certain. They might, however, feel possessed to play out of their skins. In normal times this would be the toughest sell of the season but, for many of the 2,000 supporters who will be allowed inside the Emirates, its meaning is beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A historic moment for the club,” is how Arsenal hailed the reopening of their turnstiles, which will click back into action before those at any other top-flight club owing to the calendar’s quirks. It will come almost nine months after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/arsenal-west-ham-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Arsenal beat West Ham with a goal from Alexandre Lacazette&lt;/a&gt;. That brought a near-capacity house down but then football fell silent; its return in front of gaping, windswept stands has felt decidedly strange but now a slice of what makes the sport beautiful is coming back, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/29/echoing-stadium-may-be-a-wintry-void-but-arsenal-fans-cannot-wait-to-return"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>It was Maradona's defiance that most inspired me | Kenan Malik</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/29/it-was-maradonas-defiance-that-most-inspired-me</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Footballing genius aside, his greatness lay in transcending his all too human flaws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can still remember where I was when, in 1986, Diego Maradona scored with the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-recounts-hand-of-god-incident-2006-bbc-interview-video"&gt;“hand of God”&lt;/a&gt;. In a flat on the Coventry Cross estate, in east London. An Asian family lived there, one of a handful on the estate, who had faced vicious racist attacks. An England-Argentina game, just four years after the Falklands conflict, was a threatening proposition. I was part of a group that organised support for besieged black families. So, there I was, with half an eye on what might be happening outside, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ccNkksrfls"&gt;watching Maradona destroy England&lt;/a&gt;, first with his left hand and then, four minutes later, by &lt;a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/maradona-greatest-goal-1986-fifa-world-cup-england-days-brazil-2296355"&gt;slaloming through the England team&lt;/a&gt;, finding space where none should have been, scoring possibly the most audacious goal in World Cup history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the praise heaped upon Maradona over the past week, it’s easy to forget how despised he was in Britain in those days. Or why many, like me, took to him because he was so despised. He was to football &lt;a href="https://kenanmalik.com/2016/06/05/i-dont-have-to-be-what-you-want-me-to-be/"&gt;as Muhammad Ali had been to boxing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/29/it-was-maradonas-defiance-that-most-inspired-me"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Being there: football fans in stadiums – buy a Guardian photograph</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2020/nov/28/being-there-football-fans-in-stadiums-buy-a-guardian-photograph</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guardian sports photographer Tom Jenkins has been attending many top level matches behind closed doors since football restarted and like many of us keeps thinking about the lack of fans at the games. To mark their significance the Guardian is offering readers the chance to buy exclusive prints from Tom’s archive featuring fans attending historical games over the years. A percentage of profits from every print sold will be donated to the charity &lt;a href="https://www.footballbeyondborders.org/"&gt;Football Beyond Borders&lt;/a&gt;, an education charity that supports disadvantaged young people in the UK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/remembering-football-fans-in-stadiums"&gt;Buy your print here&lt;/a&gt; for just £55 including free delivery (30x40cm print size).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photographs are presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks and are dispatched via Royal Mail. Global shipping is available. Email: &lt;a href="mailto:guardianprintsales@theprintspace.co.uk"&gt;guardianprintsales@theprintspace.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2020/nov/28/being-there-football-fans-in-stadiums-buy-a-guardian-photograph"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tony Pulis: 'I'm softer but there’s still that little streak in me'</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/tony-pulis-sheffield-wednesday-manager-i-am-softer-but-there-is-still-that-little-streak-in-me</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sheffield Wednesday’s first goal under their new manager was from a set piece but there is more to him, says a former player&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was inevitable the first goal of the Tony Pulis era at Sheffield Wednesday would stem from a superbly executed set piece. Adam Reach racing from back post to penalty spot to sidefoot home Barry Bannan’s corner may do little to enhance Brand Pulis but, then again, a manager pigeonholed as a firefighter has long given up trying to alter perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/17/tony-pulis-leaves-middlesbrough-manager"&gt;departing Middlesbrough 18 months ago&lt;/a&gt; and returning to the game to again succeed Garry Monk, this time at Hillsborough, a fortnight ago Pulis spent time swotting up on the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton – “I don’t like fiction, I like reading proper history,” he says – and went to Corsica (to celebrate Napoleon’s 250th birthday), California and visited &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/apr/21/david-smith-rorkes-drift-africa"&gt;Rorke’s Drift in South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/tony-pulis-sheffield-wednesday-manager-i-am-softer-but-there-is-still-that-little-streak-in-me"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Director Asif Kapadia: ‘Diego and Maradona were two different people’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/diego-and-maradona-were-two-different-people</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Film director recalls the long and rocky road to meeting the mercurial subject of his film&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football is a huge part of my life. I was 14 when &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-obituary"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt; scored the two goals against England – the hand of God and the wonder goal. Despite the first goal, I always thought he was the best player in the world. I’ve always been a fan of outsiders, rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone wanted to be Maradona. He was the global phenomenon. The pope wanted to meet him. Fidel Castro would sit and listen to Diego tell a story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/diego-and-maradona-were-two-different-people"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'We cannot change it': Klopp frustrated as VAR controversy denies Liverpool – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/28/we-cannot-change-it-klopp-frustrated-as-var-controversy-denies-liverpool-win-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Salah and Saido Mane both had goals disallowed by the video referee, before referee Stuart Attwell awarded Brighton a late penalty after reviewing contact between Andy Robertson and Danny Welbeck on his monitor. Pascal Gross struck home the penalty to salvage a 1-1 draw for the home side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It's a penalty because the ref whistled it,' said Klopp, who had sarcastically clapped the assistant referee when the penalty was called. 'When the ref thinks it's enough, we cannot change that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/28/brighton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Pascal Gross hits late penalty after VAR drama as Brighton deny Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/nov/28/brighton-v-liverpool-premier-league-live"&gt;Brighton 1-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/28/we-cannot-change-it-klopp-frustrated-as-var-controversy-denies-liverpool-win-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gary Lineker: Maradona was 'like a messiah' in Argentina – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/27/gary-lineker-maradona-was-like-a-messiah-in-argentina-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Former England forward Gary Lineker paid tribute to Argentina's legendary footballer Diego Maradona, who died on Wednesday at the age of 60 after he suffered heart failure at his home in Buenos Aires. Lineker, who played against the Argentine in the 1986 World Cup, said Maradona was understandably 'treated almost like a messiah' in Argentina because he was one of, if not, the greatest footballer of all time.&amp;nbsp; Maradona led his country to World Cup glory in Mexico in 1986 with Argentina and won multiple honours with club sides Barcelona and Napoli – where he is also revered. On Wednesday, Lineker had split opinion when he referenced Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' goal which knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup quarter-final when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1331637479640870917?s=20"&gt;paying his respects on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/brave-intelligent-diego-maradona-was-a-man-who-moved-through-different-air"&gt;Brave, intelligent Diego Maradona was a man who moved through different air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/27/gary-lineker-maradona-was-like-a-messiah-in-argentina-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Groups of supporters gathered in Naples and Buenos Aires to show impassioned support for the Argentinian icon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/25/remembering-diego-maradona-football-legend-dies-aged-60-video-obituary"&gt;Remembering Diego Maradona: football legend dies aged 60 – video obituary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/26/happiness-sadness-rebellion-what-maradona-meant-to-his-fans-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The footballing world has paid tribute to Diego Maradona after his death at the age of 60. 'The amount of joy and pleasure and his commitment for world football. He made world football better,' said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola. Maradona's former teammate Jorge Valdano broke down and could hardly speak when asked about his memories of the Argentinian legend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/26/the-best-and-worst-moments-of-diego-maradona-turbulent-career"&gt;The best and worst moments of Diego Maradona’s turbulent career&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/26/the-greatest-idol-football-world-pays-tribute-to-diego-maradona-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Remembering Diego Maradona: football legend dies aged 60 – video obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/25/remembering-diego-maradona-football-legend-dies-aged-60-video-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/diego-maradona"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt;, widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time, has died at the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maradona&amp;nbsp;was a uniquely gifted player with a bewitching style that was all his own. He rose from the streets of Buenos Aires to reach the pinnacle of his sport leading Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 and scoring the infamous '&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/08/world-cup-moments-maradona-hand-god"&gt;Hand of God'&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;goal along the way. Maradona played for Boca Juniors, Barcelona and Napoli in a storied club career, and later managed Argentina at the 2010 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declaring three days of national mourning, Alberto Fernández, the president of Argentina, said: 'You took us to the top of the world. You made us immensely happy. You were the greatest of them all'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-dies-one-of-greatest-footballers-of-all-time-argentina-world-cup-1986"&gt;Diego Maradona, one of the greatest footballers of all time, dies aged 60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-dies-aged-60-latest-tributes-and-reaction"&gt;Maradona dies aged 60: tributes and reaction – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/25/remembering-diego-maradona-football-legend-dies-aged-60-video-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Supporters congregated across Maradona's home city of Buenos Aires to pay tribute to the World Cup-winning captain. The Argentinian was also mourned in Naples where he spent seven seasons playing for Napoli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-dies-one-of-greatest-footballers-of-all-time-argentina-world-cup-1986"&gt;Diego Maradona, one of the greatest footballers of all time, dies aged 60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-obituary"&gt;Diego Maradona obituary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-dies-aged-60-latest-tributes-and-reaction"&gt;Maradona dies aged 60: tributes and reaction – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/nov/26/fans-in-argentina-and-naples-mourn-death-of-diego-maradona-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Diego Simeone's new and improved Atlético Madrid on title trail again | Sid Lowe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/24/diego-simeones-new-and-improved-atletico-madrid-on-title-trail-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not a repeat of 2013-14: Atlético are playing expansive football and cemented their favourites tag against Barcelona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Saturday night, not long after his players had beaten Barcelona 1-0, immortalised a moment even they hadn’t experienced before with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcosllorente/status/1330271609085636611’s=20"&gt;a celebratory photo&lt;/a&gt; taken in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/01/were-robbing-everyone-la-liga-left-to-lament-lost-dressing-rooms"&gt;an improvised recovery room&lt;/a&gt; beneath the stands and headed home still in their kit, Diego Simeone sat in an empty auditorium and started another Zoom call. A series of journalists appeared on screen, taking it in turns attempting to get him to say Atlético Madrid are going to win the league. Or at least try to. One by one they failed, until somebody asked if he saw any similarities between this team and the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/19/atletico-madrid-la-liga-title-impossible"&gt;took the title&lt;/a&gt; six years ago. “No,” he said, “I don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/24/diego-simeones-new-and-improved-atletico-madrid-on-title-trail-again"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ageless Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to take care of business for Milan | Nicky Bandini</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/23/ageless-zlatan-ibrahimovic-continues-to-take-care-of-business-for-milan-serie-a</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Milan’s senior coaching staff had to watch from home but the 39-year-old did their job for them at Napoli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefano Pioli was working from home last week. A common experience for many people in 2020, but not a straightforward adjustment when your job is to manage a football club that sits top of its domestic league. Trickier still when you are trying to prepare for an away game at a ground where your team has not won in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of leading Milan’s training sessions ahead of their visit to Napoli on Sunday, Pioli plonked himself in front of a monitor and watched a live stream sent back from a drone. He communicated observations to a member of the club’s analytics team stationed beside the pitch. They, in turn, would run the information over to Daniele Bonera – the manager’s third-in-command.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/23/ageless-zlatan-ibrahimovic-continues-to-take-care-of-business-for-milan-serie-a"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Werder Bremen set niche Bundesliga record in Bayern game that got away</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/23/werder-bremen-set-niche-bundesliga-record-in-bayern-game-that-got-away</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Florian Kohfeldt’s team might have beaten Bayern. They also might have lost but settled for their now habitual 1-1 scoreline &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Werder Bremen arrived in Munich with the possibility of setting a peculiar record. Having drawn 1-1 in their last four Bundesliga meetings, they had equalled a 40-year-old run by Bayer Leverkusen and had, in theory at least, the opportunity to supplant &lt;em&gt;Die Werkself &lt;/em&gt;in the most niche of trivia categories. With Bayern to face, nobody thought it would actually happen, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/23/fifa-bans-head-of-african-football-for-five-years-after-misappropriation-of-funds"&gt;Fifa bans head of African football for five years after misappropriation of funds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/23/werder-bremen-set-niche-bundesliga-record-in-bayern-game-that-got-away"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rebranded Football Australia forecasts $7.3m loss as Covid hits game hard</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/25/football-federation-australia-agm-financial-results</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;FA reports $1.814m loss in financial year 2019-20&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worse outlook for next year as a result of broadcast deal &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football Federation Australia insists its rebranding will not cost a cent as it prepares for a loss of $7.3m for the 2020-21 financial year. FFA will now be known as Football Australia (FA), with the name change voted in at Wednesday’s Annual General Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FA announced it had lost $1.814m in the 2019-20 financial year, with the loss of crowds due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a significant reduction in the A-League broadcast deal stripping the governing body of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/25/football-federation-australia-agm-financial-results"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Atlético Madrid's Carrasco punishes Ter Stegen to increase Barcelona woe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/21/atletico-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Atlético Madrid punished a mistake by the Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André Ter Stegen to close out a 1-0 win at the Wanda Metropolitano. The German had a rush of blood in first-half stoppage time when he raced up field to try to shutdown a counterattack, only to be left red-faced as Yannick Carrasco took the ball around him and knocked it into the empty net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/21/european-roundup-bayern-munich-real-madrid-juventus"&gt;European roundup: Real Madrid and Bayern both held to lacklustre draws&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/21/atletico-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Germany's low ebb under Löw put into sharp focus by Spain's six-shooters | Sid Lowe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/18/germany-joachim-low-sharp-focus-spain-six-nations-league</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Germany’s worst result since 1931 raises more questions about the coach’s methods and the players he has frozen out &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth official was preparing to raise the board one last time when Luis Enrique drew up close and said something. Even in the quiet of an empty arena the Spain manager couldn’t be heard clearly, but he seemed to be suggesting there was no need to add any more time. Germany had had enough, and long ago. To his left, Joachim Löw sat in the shadow of the bench, not moving, which is how he had sat for most of the night. Above him, Oliver Bierhoff, the national team director, watched in silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board went up. “OK, two minutes,” someone could be heard saying, almost apologetically and in Spanish. In German, no one said anything. There was just … &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. Löw rested his hand on his chin, defeated and distant. On the scoreboard, which the few people in this arena photographed for posterity, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/17/ferran-torress-treble-helps-spain-humble-germany-in-nations-league"&gt;it said 6-0&lt;/a&gt;. The list of Spain’s goalscorers filled the screen. Through the silence, radio broadcasters shouted about a historic night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/18/germany-joachim-low-sharp-focus-spain-six-nations-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tite's results show he is the best man to lead Brazil to the World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/19/tites-results-show-he-is-the-best-man-to-lead-brazil-to-the-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are always murmurs in Brazil about replacing the manager, but his record in the job is extremely impressive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TomSandersonBCN"&gt;Tom Sanderson&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://ygfoot.com/"&gt;Yellow and Green Football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injuries and Covid-19 threatened to derail Brazil in their two World Cup qualifiers in the international break, relieving Tite of no fewer than nine players, yet the Seleção finished off 2020 in perfect fashion, beating Uruguay 2-0 in Montevideo on Tuesday night after seeing off Venezuela in São Paulo three days earlier. After four rounds of fixtures in South American qualifying, Brazil are the only team with a 100% record. There is a long way to go – South American sides have to play 18 qualifiers in their 10-team group – but, after scoring 12 goals and conceding just two in four straight wins, things are looking good for Tite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brazil had not lost to Uruguay since 2001, so should have been confident as they made their way across the border. Yet, following a limp 1-0 win over Venezuela on Friday, some fans were suggesting that the national team may be better off with a different manager. Those mutterings have only increased since their defeat to Belgium in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2018, so Tite needed his team to make a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did. Although this wasn’t the 4-1 rout of Uruguay that Brazil enjoyed in 2017 – when Edinson Cavani gave the hosts an early lead from the penalty spot before Brazil roared back thanks to a Paulinho hat-trick and delightful scooped lob from Neymar – the performance reaffirmed Tite’s credentials. Some supporters would prefer to see Flamengo manager Rogério Ceni or São Paulo boss Fernando Diniz in charge, but neither of them has a CV to rival Tite, who won the Brazilian league title, the Copa Libertadores and Fifa Club World Cup while in charge of Corinthians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/19/tites-results-show-he-is-the-best-man-to-lead-brazil-to-the-world-cup"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hungary's Golden Squad: the greatest team never to win it all? | John Ashdown</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/16/hungary-golden-squad-the-greatest-football-team-never-to-win-it-all</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Magical Magyars embarked on one of football’s most remarkable streaks, only to fall short in the Miracle of Bern&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wankdorf Stadium in Bern was getting a soaking, but the sun was shining on Hungary’s brightest generation. Gusztáv Sebes’s side had not lost since May 1950 – an undefeated international streak that would not be surpassed until 1993 – and here they were, with 63,800 increasingly sodden souls watching on from the open terraces, cruising to victory in the 1954 World Cup final. Their four matches en route had brought a faintly ludicrous 25 goals: South Korea hammered 9-0 and West Germany taken apart 8-3 in the group stage, Brazil swept aside 4-2 in a brutal quarter-final and Uruguay, the holders, edged out by the same score after extra-time in a semi-final for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Germany, the tournament’s surprise package, were lined up to go under the steamroller again in the final and their fear seemed palpable in the opening 10 minutes. Werner Liebrich played the ball straight to József Bozsik 40 yards from his own goal. Bozsik fed Sándor Kocsis, whose shot deflected off a defender and fell to Ferenc Puskás, who crashed the ball home. Two minutes later, Werner Kohlmeyer and goalkeeper Toni Turek appeared overwhelmed by panic as Kocsis pressed, allowing Zoltán Czibor to scoot in from the right and prod the ball into the empty net. Two-nil, eight minutes gone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/16/hungary-golden-squad-the-greatest-football-team-never-to-win-it-all"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Gerrard reveals he asked Pepijn Lijnders, the first-team development coach, to always include Alexander-Arnold in his group when taking his ’B’ Licence course, and handed him the captain’s armband during a comeback game in Liverpool’s Under-18s side last season. “It was my way of telling Trent that I believed he could make it for Liverpool one day,” Gerrard writes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/06/from-degaard-to-mastour-what-happened-to-next-generation-2015"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Maradona the footballer had no flaws – Maradona the man was a victim | Jorge Valdano</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/26/maradona-the-footballer-had-no-flaws-maradona-the-man-was-a-victim</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is something perverse about a life that fulfils all your dreams and Diego suffered the generosity of fate like no other. The terrible journey from human to myth divided him in two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who screw up their faces sneering as they contemplate the latest incarnation of Maradona, the one who had difficulties walking, struggled to talk, embraced [the Venezuela president Nicolás] Maduro and did whatever he felt like, would be better off abandoning this farewell which embraces the genius and absolves the man. They will not find a single reproach here because the footballer had no flaws and the man was a victim. Of whom? Of me or of you, for example, who at some moment must have eulogised him pitilessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something perverse about a life that fulfils all your dreams and Diego suffered the generosity of fate like no other. The terrible, terminal journey from human to myth divided him in two: on the one side Diego; on the other Maradona. Fernando Signorini, his fitness coach, a sensitive, intelligent man who may well have known him better than anyone else, used to say: “I would follow Diego to the end of the earth; I wouldn’t follow Maradona to the corner.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/26/maradona-the-footballer-had-no-flaws-maradona-the-man-was-a-victim"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'He took us all to heaven': football fans react to Diego Maradona's death</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/26/diego-maradona-heaven-football-fans-react-death</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fans across the world – from Buenos Aires to Bedford – have been in touch to explain what Maradona means to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps the strength of feeling for Diego Maradona that sets him apart from other great footballers. Having grown up in poverty and gone on to be revered as a world champion, his story has been an inspiration, while his mesmerising skills gave millions of fans unadulterated joy time and time again. Football fans around the world have been in touch to share their tributes, telling of the lasting impact he had on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is that feeling stronger than in Maradona’s native Argentina. “Maradona was one of those people who, unintentionally, helped everyone to understand that, even being human and fallible, we can do amazing things. Things that seems impossible to reach or even dream,” says Diego Martínez, a 34-year-old designer. “He also made me realise that we’re not entirely good or bad; we are human. Even though Maradona didn’t seem from this planet sometimes, he was one of our kind, but one of his kind.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/26/diego-maradona-heaven-football-fans-react-death"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Fiver | Getting their hoops kicked by Sparta Prague</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/the-fiver-celtic-rangers-hoops-kicked-by-sparta-prague</link>

Sign up now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, shipping a two-goal lead against Benfica for the second time in three weeks isn’t a great look for Pope’s O’Rangers. Especially as the Teddy Bhears would now be through to the knockout stage of Euro Vase if they’d managed to hold on to just one of them. But it wasn’t too long ago that they were getting themselves knocked out by the likes of Progres Niederkorn, so going toe-to-toe with a bona fide European giant is a sign of genuine progress. With things slowly coming together at Ibrox, perma-worried boss Steven Gerrard was able to relax his trademark frown into Light Crease, its lowest setting, for Thursday night’s post-match interview, which there’s no need to quote. The forehead speaks volumes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/the-fiver-celtic-rangers-hoops-kicked-by-sparta-prague"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Classic YouTube | Diego Armando Maradona, nerveless kicking and Football Manager kids</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/26/diego-armando-maradona-nerveless-kicking-and-football-manager-kids-classic-youtube</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s roundup includes our tribute to El Diego, plus England rugby highlights and Chelsea v Tottenham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Diego Maradona, one of the greatest footballers of all time, died on Wednesday aged 60. It’s hard to know where to begin, but let’s start with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XegYZ8y3xMY"&gt;five of his greatest World Cup goals&lt;/a&gt;. No 1 on that list, the ‘goal of the century’, inspired some memorable commentary from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx6jEh_Zu2M"&gt;Barry Davies&lt;/a&gt; – “you have to say that’s magnificent” – Argentina’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wVho3I0NtU"&gt;Victor Hugo Morales&lt;/a&gt; going loco and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnv6m4M_TFM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;a concise effort&lt;/a&gt; from RTÉ’s Jimmy Magee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assists weren’t bad either: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c7uMogBM9Q"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, to Jorge Burruchaga, won the World Cup and four years later he&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LezxSVOrvk"&gt; dissected the Brazilian defence&lt;/a&gt;. Here are more of El Diego’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIci4TEqAFw"&gt;World Cup highlights&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfsLzXYdEQ8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;epic post-match celebrations&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. Gary Lineker paid &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1331680485672706048"&gt;a fantastic tribute&lt;/a&gt; to Maradona on BT Sport, highlighting what made him so unique. And here is the England striker being &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Eo-2byMdqQ"&gt;shown round La Bombonera in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/footballtips/status/1331643784401195008"&gt;a 2006 meeting with Diego&lt;/a&gt;, who seems genuinely pleased to see Lineker and wasn’t shy about mentioning ‘that’ goal from 1986.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/26/diego-armando-maradona-nerveless-kicking-and-football-manager-kids-classic-youtube"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Playing for England with a teammate from the same non-English club | The Knowledge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Plus: the best ever penalty shootout comeback, the origins of shirty goal celebrations and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com"&gt;Mail &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com"&gt;us&lt;/a&gt; your questions or tweet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu"&gt;@TheKnowledge_GU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When Jude Bellingham made his England debut against the Republic of Ireland, he joined his Borussia Dortmund teammate Jadon Sancho on the field. Is this the first time England have had multiple players from the same non-English team?”&lt;/strong&gt; wonders Colin Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course not, Colin. Many of you wrote in with examples from Rangers in the early 90s but Dara O’Reilly did this and more, so apologies if you feel irked for missing out on a namecheck.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Gary Stevens and Terry Butcher played together for England on 11 occasions while they were both Rangers players, three of those with Trevor Steven, also of Rangers playing, and a further one where Chris Woods, also of Rangers was in goal, for four Rangers players. Mark Walters’ only England cap came as a Rangers player, also with Woods in goal, a friendly against New Zealand in 1991. But, excluding British clubs, we have the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/playing-for-england-with-a-teammate-from-the-same-non-english-club"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Casey Stoney out-thinks her Manchester City counterpart, Birmingham continue to shine and Bristol City get off the mark&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on from last season’s success, the WSL used the men’s international weekend to schedule three huge games, and were rewarded with a scintillating set of high-level thrillers. In the UK, 250,000 people watched the Manchester derby, and I’m excited to see the figures for the US–rights have been bought by NBC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/16/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Golden Goal: Terry Gibson for Manchester United v Arsenal (1987) | Rob Smyth</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/14/golden-goal-terry-gibson-for-manchester-united-v-arsenal-1987</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A violent game remembered for a spectacular rampage by Norman Whiteside had a poignant footnote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every golden goal has to glister. One of the most euphoric moments of Terry Gibson’s career was a tap-in from eight yards in a match his team would probably have won anyway. After a year of incessant frustration, it was his first goal for Manchester United – and, as it turned out, his last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson was marginalised almost as soon as he was signed by Ron Atkinson, who was subsequently replaced by Sir Alex Ferguson in November 1986. Two months later, Gibson made one and scored in injury-time to secure a violent 2-0 win over the league leaders Arsenal. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/25/match.manchesterunited"&gt;Not for the last time&lt;/a&gt;, they left Old Trafford bristling with injustice as an unbeaten run – 22 games this time – went up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/14/golden-goal-terry-gibson-for-manchester-united-v-arsenal-1987"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Football quiz: who was Roy Keane ranting about in these quotes?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/13/football-quiz-who-was-roy-keane-ranting-about-in-these-quotes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which players and managers took a tongue-lashing from Keane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"I am sick to death of this goalkeeper!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Darren Randolph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;David de Gea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Jordan Pickford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Roy Carroll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"He’s had loads of plaudits over the last few months - I know he’s still a young man - but his body language today was shocking, really shocking. Shrugging his shoulders when things weren’t going his way, you roll your sleeves up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Paul Pogba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Mason Greenwood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Anthony Martial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Marcus Rashford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"Who is he, Mother Theresa?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Niall Quinn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Alan Shearer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Gary Neville&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"Stuff like that kinda almost insults me. What am I supposed to do? Give up? Not cover every blade of grass? Not do my best for my teammates? Not do my best for my club? To be honest, I get actually offended when people throw quotes like that at me as if I'm supposed to be honoured by it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Mick McCarthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Clive Tyldesley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Ron Atkinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"I felt I was entitled to say that. He was just a mascot for them. Walking around .... – ‘Look at me, how big I am’ – and he didn’t even own the bloody thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Mick McCarthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;David Gill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"He said, ‘I’ve had enough of you. It’s time we sorted this out.’ So I said, ‘Okay.’ And we had a fight. It felt like 10 minutes. There was a lot of noise – ****’s a big lad. I woke up the next morning. I kind of vaguely remembered the fight ... My hand was really sore and one of my fingers was bent backward ... Throughout the flight, **** wore his sunglasses. He never took them off, and it wasn’t very sunny ... Butty had refereed the fight. He even got a new nickname for it – Mills Lane, after the famous boxing referee. Anyway, **** had grabbed me, I’d head-butted him – we’d been fighting for ages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Steve Bruce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Ruud van Nistelrooy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Niall Quinn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Peter Schmeichel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"One of the best pros you could ever come across, so being late for the bus tarnished him; you’d have thought he’d been caught with drugs or something. He was having a go at me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Gary Neville&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Denis Irwin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Andy Cole&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"Reinventing the game, apparently. Sugar lumps at half-time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Jürgen Klopp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Arsène Wenger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Pep Guardiola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Julian Nagelsmann&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="question__text"&gt;"He was an absolute prick to play against.

This guy is 30 years of age, an international player, he’s a car crash. He keeps on making these type of mistakes. He was rightfully punished for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Jordan Henderson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Kyle Walker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Joe Hart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="answer__text"&gt;Phil Neville&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="score__min-score"&gt;1 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="score__title"&gt;Oh dear.

      <title>Diego Maradona: the achingly human superstar who embodied Argentina | Marcela Mora y Araujo</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-the-achingly-human-superstar-who-embodied-argentina</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maradona was a perfect representation of the human ability to be contradictory, to convey ugly and beautiful at once&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possesses at least two things besides: gratitude and purity” – Friedrich Nietzsche, on love, perseverance, and moving beyond good v evil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diego Maradona said that when you’ve been to the moon and back, things get difficult. “You become addicted to the moon and it’s not always possible to come back down.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-the-achingly-human-superstar-who-embodied-argentina"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Child genius Diego Maradona became the fulfilment of a prophecy | Jonathan Wilson</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-argentina-child-genius-who-became-the-fulfilment-of-a-prophecy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blessed with sublime talent developed in the slums of Buenos Aires, &lt;em&gt;cabecita negra&lt;/em&gt; went on to become everything that defined Argentina’s football principles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1920s, as Argentina, a booming immigrant nation, sought a sense of identity, it became apparent that football was one of the few things that bound its disparate population together. No matter what your background, you wanted the team in the blue and white striped shirts to win – and that meant the way the national side played was of political and cultural significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate was played out in the pages of El Gráfico, and a consensus emerged that Argentinian football stood in opposition to the game of the British, the quasi-colonial power having largely departed by the beginning of the first world war. On the vast grassy playing fields of the British schools, football was about power and running and energy. The Argentinian, by contrast, learned the game in the &lt;em&gt;potreros&lt;/em&gt;, the vacant lots of the slums, on small, hard, crowded pitches where there was no teacher to step in if it got a bit too rough; their game was about being streetwise, tight, technical ability – and cunning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-argentina-child-genius-who-became-the-fulfilment-of-a-prophecy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'Nothing about me was cool': Gareth Southgate on making dreams reality</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/26/gareth-southgate-on-making-dreams-reality-book-england-manager</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new book by England’s manager charting his journey is designed to inspire young people &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gareth Southgate can still feel the hot flush of teenage embarrassment. It was his first day as a Crystal Palace apprentice and he had made the socially fatal error of turning up in smart clothes – school shirt and trousers, to be precise – only to find that the rest of his year group were in jeans or tracksuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It felt like a disaster before I’d even started,” the England manager says. “All my peers seemed so much more streetwise and I was just this kid from the suburbs with goofy teeth. Nothing about me was cool and I felt like I’d never fit in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/26/gareth-southgate-on-making-dreams-reality-book-england-manager"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Anton Ferdinand: 'I have kicked myself for years for not speaking out'</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/20/anton-ferdinand-i-have-kicked-myself-for-years-for-not-speaking-out-john-terry</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Former defender discusses the pain of the John Terry incident, the abuse his mother suffered and his documentary on racism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I carried the burden of not speaking out for so long, for nine years,” Anton Ferdinand says as he explains how haunted he has been. Ferdinand suffered terribly as the victim in the most controversial incident of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2011/oct/24/john-terry-anton-ferdinand-video" title=""&gt;alleged racial abuse&lt;/a&gt; in the history of English football. During a Premier League game between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea in October 2011, John Terry said the words “fucking black cunt” in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/23/john-terry-racist-remarks-anton-ferdinand" title=""&gt;a spat with Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt; that ended up in court and the subject of a Football Association disciplinary hearing – which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/03/john-terry-stripped-england-captaincy-racism" title=""&gt;cost Terry the England captaincy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, however, the world has been oblivious to the pain Ferdinand endured. His decision to remain silent burned a hole inside him. “I have kicked myself and beat myself up for years for not speaking out,” he says quietly. This is Ferdinand’s first interview since participating in a searing and deeply moving BBC documentary – &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000pzpr" title=""&gt;Football, Racism and Me&lt;/a&gt; – which will be screened a week on Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/20/anton-ferdinand-i-have-kicked-myself-for-years-for-not-speaking-out-john-terry"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
