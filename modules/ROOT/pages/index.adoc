=== Social Example

image:diagram.png[JavaScript & Node.js]

Joe knows Sally, and Sally knows Anna. Bob is excluded from the result because, in addition to being a 2nd-degree friend through Sally, he's also a first-degree friend.

=== Network Management

image:diagram.png[JavaScript & Node.js]

Only Webserver VM depends on Server 1. Because we're looking at variable length paths of DEPENDS_ON relationships, we're also able to determine that Public Website would be impacted by an outage of Server 1.

[.column]
=== Fraud Detection

image:diagram.png[JavaScript & Node.js]

Hank shares an account with Abby. Abby shares a SSN with Sophie and Max. Given that we suspect Hank may be involved in fraudulent activity, we can flag the Cayman account, Sophie, and Abby as possible fraudulent entities.
