== Getting Started

[.column]
=== 1. Download Neo4j

You can either link:/download/[Download Neo4j Desktop^] locally, link:/aura/[run Neo4j in the Cloud with Aura^] or link:/sandbox/[try Neo4j free for 7 days with Neo4j Sandbox^].

* xref:graph-database.adoc[What is a Graph Database?]
* xref:neo4j-desktop.adoc[Neo4j Desktop Starter Guide]
* xref:graph-platform.adoc[The Neo4j Graph Platform]

[.column]
=== 2. Connecting to Neo4j

There is nothing worse than an empty database.
You can either download one of our example data set or model and import your own from many sources.



* xref:cypher:index.adoc[The Cypher Query Language]
* xref:data-modeling.adoc[Graph Data Modeling]
* xref:data-import.adoc[Importing Data into Neo4j]

[.column]
=== 3. Build your application

You can use a set of Neo4j products to share your data or build out your own application in the programming language of your preference.

== Start with a Use Case

// * Fraud Detection & Analytics

// * Recommendation Engines
// * Master Data Management
// * Social Media and Social Network Graphs
// * Identity and Access Management


[.column]
=== Social Example

image:diagram.png[JavaScript & Node.js]

Joe knows Sally, and Sally knows Anna. Bob is excluded from the result because, in addition to being a 2nd-degree friend through Sally, he's also a first-degree friend.
Pad the content out by a couple of lines to even things up.

[.column]
=== Network Management

image:diagram.png[JavaScript & Node.js]

Only Webserver VM depends on Server 1. Because we're looking at variable length paths of DEPENDS_ON relationships, we're also able to determine that Public Website would be impacted by an outage of Server 1.  A little bit of padding.

[.column]
=== Fraud Detection

image:diagram.png[JavaScript & Node.js]

Hank shares an account with Abby. Abby shares a SSN with Sophie and Max. Given that we suspect Hank may be involved in fraudulent activity, we can flag the Cayman account, Sophie, and Abby as possible fraudulent entities.
