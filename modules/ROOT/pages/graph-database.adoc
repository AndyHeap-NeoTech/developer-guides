[#what-is-graphdb]
A graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents.  Data is stored much as you might sketch a set of ideas on a whiteboard.  This helps store data without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using your data.

[#why-graphdb]
== Why Graph Databases?

We live in a connected world, and understanding most domains requires processing rich sets of connections to understand what's really happening. Often, we find that the connections between itms are as important as the items themselves, and graphs are ideally suited. 

How else do people do this today?  Existing relational and document databases store these relationships, and navigate them with expensive JOIN operations or cross-lookups.  In a graph database, there simply are no JOINs or lookups. Relationships are stored natively right along with the data elements (the nodes).  Graphs are optimized for travesing through data quickly; millions of connections per second, per core.

// TODO: not ready yet but this point here is where we would introduce the "graph problem problem" of the key technical challenges graphs solve, and link to the main developer page when it's ready.
And you'll find this is a very common problem.  Many modern data problems involve navigating deep hierarchies,
finding hidden connections between distant items, and discovering inter-relationships between data items.  Social networks, payment networks, roads...you'll find that everything is an interconnected graph of relationships.  And when we want to ask questions about the real world, many questions are _about the relationships_ rather than about the individual data elements.

[#property-graph]
== The Property Graph Model

In Neo4j, information is organized as nodes, relationships, and properties.

.Building blocks of the property graph model

*_Nodes_* are the entities in the graph.
Nodes can be tagged with _labels_, representing their different roles in your domain. (For example, `Person`).
They can hold any number of key-value pairs, or attributes called _properties_. (For example, `name`)
Node labels may also serve to attach metadata (such as index or constraint information) to certain nodes.

*_Relationships_* provide directed, named, connections between two node entities (e.g. Person `LOVES` Person).
Relationships always have a direction, a type, a start node, and an end node, and they can have properties, just like nodes.
Neo4j is optimized for relationships, so nodes can have any number or type of relationships without sacrificing performance.
Although relationships are always _directed_, they can be navigated efficiently in any direction.

A deeper treatment of each of these is given in the link:/developer/data-modeling/[Data Modeling section].

[#neo4j-overview]
== What is Neo4j?

Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database that provides an ACID-compliant transactional backend for your applications.
Initial development began in 2003, but it has been publicly available since 2007.
The source code, written in Java and Scala, is available for free on https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j[GitHub^] and can be run as a managed service via link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/?ref=developer-guides[AuraDB].

You can run Neo4j yourself with either Community Edition or Enterprise Edition. The Enterprise Edition includes all that Community Edition has to offer, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover abilities.

Neo4j is a native graph database, which means that it implements a true graph model all the way down to the storage level  The data is stored just as you whiteboard it, and the database manages a set of pointers which allows you to traverse the graph.
Neo4j provides what you'd expect out of a database; ACID transactions, cluster support, and runtime failover - which is why so many people use it in production scenarios for large enterprise workloads.

The following particular features make Neo4j the easiest graph database for developers, architects, and DBAs:

- *Cypher*, a declarative query language similar to SQL, but optimized for graphs.
Now used by other databases like SAP HANA Graph and Redis graph via the http://www.opencypher.org/[openCypher project^].
- *Constant time traversals* in big graphs for both depth and breadth due to efficient representation of nodes and relationships.
Enables scale-up to billions of nodes on moderate hardware.
- *Flexible* property graph schema that can adapt over time, making it possible to materialize and add new relationships later to shortcut and speed up the domain data when the business needs change.
- link:/developer/language-guides[*Drivers*] for popular programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, .NET, Python, and many more.
